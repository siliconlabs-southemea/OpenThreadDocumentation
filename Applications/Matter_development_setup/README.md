## Summary ##
{% include list.liquid all=true %}

**Written on November 29th 2021**
**Built on WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04**
**Built on Ubuntu Server for Raspberry 20.04 LTS3**

## Description ##

This guide helps building a development environment suitable for Matter SDK

**IMPORTANT NOTE** Except for Python controller build, we recommend to setup your environment on a Native Computer or Virtual Machine

Running build procedures on Raspberry Pis might lead to errors 

Still this has been successfully used on a Raspberry pi 4 with 4GB Ram running ubuntu
